One of these traits is that a single plant produces a number of densely packed flowers which each undergo fertilization separate from each other. This allows for interesting displays of mendelian principles in cases where the genes that code for kernel color in the male pollen are different from those of the female plant. One way this can play out is by the formation of a corn cob in which the different kernels have different colors.\n",
