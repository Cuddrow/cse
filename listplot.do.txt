===== Exercise: List operations =====
label{ex:numbersinlists}
keywords=lists; basic;

!bsubex
Create a list called `mylist` and store the numbers 1, 2 and 4 in it.
!esubex

!bsubex
Use the print function to print the number 1 by calling the correct index from the list.
!esubex

!bsubex
Expand the list by adding the numbers 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256.
!esubex

!bsubex
Use the appropriate code for finding what the index number of the value 64 is, and print it to the screen.
!esubex

!bsubex
Sum all the elements in the list and print it to the screen.
!esubex

===== Exercise: Simple statistics =====
label{ex:meanfromlist}
keywords=lists; basic; statistics;

!bsubex
A group up students reported basic physical measurements. Create the following lists to store the information given:
!bc pycod
height = [176, 169, 172, 172, 179, 160, 157, 170, 190, 154, 181, 185, 168, 184]
age = [34, 33, 27, 31, 19, 34, 22, 28, 23, 32, 20, 20, 24, 30, 21, 25]
weight = [62, 46, 56, 52, 80, 51, 84, 65, 92, 55, 53, 52, 84, 84, 61]
!ec
!esubex

!bsubex
Write a program that prints the length of all the lists. If they do NOT all consist of 14 indices only, use the approriate method to delete the last indices of the lists that are longer than 14.
!esubex

!bsubex
Write the sums of all the values in each list to separate variables.
!bhint
Name your variables in a way that makes their origin easy to identify. E.g `heightsum`, `agesum`, `weightsum`
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Use the sums of the list indices to alculate the mean(average) height, age, and weight for this group of students.
!bhint
Using the length method from exercise b) can be helpful to make a flexible program.
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
How many of the students actually report having the average height, age or weight? Does this tell us anything about means in general?
