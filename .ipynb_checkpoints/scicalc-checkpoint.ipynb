    "Contrary to popular belief, animals of the genus *camelus*, such as camels and dromedarys, do not carry volumes of water in the \"humps\" on their backs. Although it is indeed true that they can drink and store large amounts of water, and survive for a long time without drinking, camels deal with the heat in much more interesting ways than one might expect. Two important adaptations in camels in order to deal with heat are a large body with concentrated fatty deposits in the \"humps\", and a high tolerance for changes in body temperature. The fat acts as a buffer that soaks thermal energy, causing the temperature rise in the body as a whole to be quite slow; there is simply a lot of body to heat up! During cold desert nights, the effect is reversed and the body is cooled more slowly than in a smaller and leaner body. Allowing themselves to be heated also reduces the thermal gradient against the environment, and thus the heating slows as the camel's body temperature rises.\n",
